# tau-alpha - a homelab

## Description
tau-alpha is my attempt to tackle the world of infrastructure. In a simple words, tau-alpha is a collection of scritpts, configs, playbooks, etc...
for OS provisioning, virtualization, Kubernetes cluster setup, self-hosting, and virtually any DIY homelab task.
