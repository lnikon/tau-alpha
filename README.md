# tau-alpha - a homelab

## Description
tau-alpha is my attempt to tackle the world of infrastructure. In simple words, tau-alpha is a collection of scripts, configs, playbooks, etc...
for OS provisioning, virtualization, Kubernetes cluster setup,  self-hosting, and virtually any DIY home lab task.
